The gyratory crusher can, just like a jaw crusher, accept boulder sizes close to 1.5 m (for the largest equipment).. This crusher can handle products with a Mohs hardness that is not necessarily less than 5. – As is the case for jaw crushers, there is not any mutual sliding on grinding surfaces, but simply rolling of the nut on concaves.
