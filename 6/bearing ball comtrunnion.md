## Trunnion Mounted Ball Valves 
The FK76C split-body, full-bore, trunnion-mounted ball valve represents the highest standards in valve technology. Its superfinefinished, trunnion-mounted ball design is just one of its many important design features. Among them are an anti-blow out stem, long-life, double-stem seal system and stem supported in bearings to ensure seals are free from operation loads.

## How Do Floating Ball Valves Work? [Floating vs. Trunnion Ball Valves]
All ball valves rely on the use of two seats, usually made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), to hold the ball in place and create a tight seal to prevent media from leaking through the valve. Floating and trunnion are two basic types of ball valve designs. Floating ball valves are the most common type of valve used in industrial piping systems.
