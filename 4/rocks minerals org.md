Instead, rocks are classified from two things: what minerals are present, and how the mineral grains are arranged. Rocks fall into three types based on the how they form. The first is igneous rocks, and includes rocks like granite and basalt. "Igneous" means "formed from fire" (notice the similarity to the word "ignite"), and refers

Magnetite (Fe3O4) is a strongly magnetic iron-rich mineral and can make rocks magnetic even when it is present in only small proportions . Hematite (Fe2O3) is the main material, along with other Fe-oxides colouring the surface of many weathered rocks and soils. It has been used as a red pigment and is the main colouring agent in red ochre.

The minerals created when a rock initially crystallizes are the rock's primary minerals, and classification systems for intrusive rocks are based on primary mineralogy. Because intrusive rocks are generally coarse-grained, we can often identify the major minerals in an outcrop, perhaps with the aid of a hand lens, to give a rock a name. Sometimes, however, we must

Rocks are composed of individual or an assemblage of minerals. Rocks are divided into three basic groups, namely igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Igneous rocks are rocks that form when magma (molten rock) rises to the Earth's surface and solidifies. The Cape Granite Suite and the Karoo dolerite intrusions are examples of igneous rocks. Sedimentary rocks

## What is the difference between a rock and a mineral?
A mineral is a naturally occurring inorganic element or compound having an orderly internal structure and characteristic chemical composition, crystal form, and physical properties. Common minerals include quartz, feldspar, mica, amphibole, olivine, and calcite. A rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals, or a body of undifferentiated mineral matter.

## Earth Materials – Rocks – Historical Geology
Clastic sedimentary rock (also called 'detrital' sedimentary rock) consists of sediment pieces (clasts/rock detritus) that come from weathered bedrock, cemented together to make a new rock. The clastic sediment is often referred to as "siliciclastic" because it is derived from the rocks of the crust which, as we have learned, is largely composed of silicate minerals of igneous rock
